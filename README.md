## This game has 2 modes (Normal Math & My Math).

* Normal math is our usual math, e.g. 5 + 8 = 13, whereas in "My Math" the largest possible number is 9.
* If the sum of the 2 numbers is less than 10, you calculate normally.
* If it's 10 or more, then we continue summing the result till we have a single digit.
* For example, 5 + 8 = 13 -> 13 is larger than 10, then (13)1 + 3 = 4, so 4 is the result of 5 + 8 in My Math.
* Hit `Enter` after providing your answer.

* There is no decimals.
* We only use sum in this game, e.g. no subtraction, multiplication, or division.
